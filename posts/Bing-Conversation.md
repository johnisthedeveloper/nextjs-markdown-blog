 Why USA started a cold war with the Soviet Union? What would USA  achieve through this cold war?

***

**Assistant:**

The Cold War began after the surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945 when the uneasy alliance between the United States and Great Britain on one hand and the Soviet Union on the other started to fall apart</a>[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.britannica.com/event/Cold-War). The major causes can be attributed to suspicion and high tension that existed between these two superpowers over control of the world</a>[<sup>2</sup>](https://ivypanda.com/essays/cold-war-4/). The conflict existed in ambitious hopes and paranoid fears of Josef Stalin on the Soviet side, and determination of U.S. and its Western allies to oppose those ambitions beyond gains achieved by Soviet army in World War II </a>[<sup>3</sup>](https://www.rbth.com/history/329163-who-started-cold-war).


As for what USA would achieve through this cold war, it is a complex topic with many different perspectives. Would you like me to look up more information?

**Assistant:**

During the Cold War, U.S. diplomacy was focused on halting the spread of communism and limiting its influence where it already existed</a>[<sup>1</sup>](https://diplomacy.state.gov/discover-diplomacy/period/cold-war-diplomacy/). American politicians believed that promoting democracy would expand individual liberties for people everywhere</a>[<sup>1</sup>](https://diplomacy.state.gov/discover-diplomacy/period/cold-war-diplomacy/). The United States also supported its allies in a recovery, development and growth process that out-consumed USSR and China</a>[<sup>2</sup>](https://www.thenewsindependent.com/what-impact-did-the-cold-war-have-on-the-united-states/).


Some achievements of USA during cold war include: International Monetary Fund, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which led to World Trade Organization, open markets, free trade, stable currencies and collective defense. It also led to end of economic nationalism and protectionism as well as promotion of anti-colonialism and self-determination </a>[<sup>3</sup>](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/cold-war-success-cost-america-its-place-global-order-67982).

 How did cold war end?

***

**Assistant:**

The Cold War ended gradually. The unity in the communist bloc was unraveling throughout the 1960s and ’70s as a split occurred between China and the Soviet Union</a>[<sup>1</sup>](https://www.britannica.com/question/How-did-the-Cold-War-end). Three events heralded the end of the Cold War: fall of Berlin Wall in 1989, reunification of Germany in 1990 and dissolution of Soviet Union in 1991</a>[<sup>2</sup>](https://alphahistory.com/coldwar/end-of-the-cold-war/). Each was brought about or shaped by demands and actions of ordinary Europeans who were determined to instigate change</a>[<sup>2</sup>](https://alphahistory.com/coldwar/end-of-the-cold-war/).


On December 3rd, 1989, Cold War ‘officially’ ended when Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev met with US president George Bush aboard a Soviet ship docked at Malta’s Marsaxlokk harbor </a>[<sup>3</sup>](https://www.timesmojo.com/how-did-the-cold-war-end/).
