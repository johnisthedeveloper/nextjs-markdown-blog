Summary of proposal (abstract)
Provide a brief summary (1,800 characters maximum, including spaces) of your outline of proposed research in language that the public can understand. This plain-language summary may be made available to the public if your application is successful.

Advanced breast cancer and ovarian cancer are deadly diseases with limited treatment options, in part due to the variability between and within patients on the genetic level. This variability is masked by bulk tissue analysis which makes it difficult to observe subgroups of cells within a tumour that share a common genetic change, referred to as clones. Fitness describes the competition between clones for survival in a cancer and provides a basis for cancer evolution, such as different susceptibility to drug therapies. New methods to study the single cells of clones in animal models representing the inherent variability of individual patients will identify candidate genes and their interactions that contribute to the complex multicellular behaviours of breast and ovarian cancer tumours. This is key to understanding who might respond to chemotherapy and crucial for the development of emerging genetically targeted therapies. I propose to combine existing experimental and statistical methods for assessing gene fitness at single cell resolution and apply this method to patient-derived mice models of different patient tumours treated with chemotherapy or novel DNA targeting drugs. This project will focus on epigenetics, various marks on DNA and proteins that alter gene expression, and their role in breast and ovarian cancer progression. Individual tumour cells will be sequenced after knocking out different genes that regulate epigenetics to identify the most important genes and how they impact tumour growth. This work will contribute to our understanding of the role of epigenetic regulators in cancer and its evolution over time, as well as their impact on the response to current and emerging therapeutic options in patients with breast or ovarian cancer.

Background: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), defined by the absence of 3 clinical biomarkers, is the subtype of breast cancer with the least favourable outcomes1. High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy2. The use of PARP inhibitor targeted therapy is restricted to the subset of patients who carry a predictive biomarker for deficient homologous recombination such as a deleterious BRCA mutation3,4. The limited therapeutic options contribute to high relapse rates and mortality of TNBC and HGSOC. Previous work from our lab stratified a patient cohort of TNBC and HGSOC based on mutation signature analysis from joint single nucleotide variation and copy number-structural variation (CNA-SV) counts derived from whole-genome sequencing5, identifying backgrounds of genomic instability including homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and enriched for fold-back inversions (FBI). Additional work from our lab has demonstrated the association of CNA-SV clones with resistance to platinum in TNBC6. This points to the role of CNA-SV mutations in the clonal fitness landscape of these tumours. Epigenetic regulators include genes encoding enzymes that introduce or remove chemical modifications to DNA and histones, and proteins that recognize these tags. These genes are implicated in cancer pathogenesis and have been explored as drug targets, but to date only histone deacetylase inhibitors are in clinical use. The goal of my project is to identify candidate epigenetic regulators that warrant further investigation as actionable targets in HRD or FBI mutational backgrounds of TNBC and HGSOC. I hypothesise unique epigenetic regulators are associated with HRD and FBI backgrounds of genomic instability in TNBC and HGSOC, and they further modulate relative sensitivity or resistance to DNA targeting agents within these backgrounds. 
Aim 1: Quantify gene fitness of a library of epigenetic regulators in a cohort of TNBC and HGSOC tumours stratified by mutational-structural characteristics. Unique patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mice from biopsies of different patients before and after relapse to chemotherapy have been established as a model capturing some of the heterogeneity of the originating disease in our lab7. PDX lines are propagated over generations by serial transplantation of dissociated tumours. I will calculate the CNA-SV clonal fitness landscape of these tumours using an adapted Wright–Fisher population genetics model6 from single cell whole genome sequencing data generated by methods established by our lab8.  Pooled PDX transplant screens will be carried out in biological triplicates to measure gene fitness in vivo. Using a novel CRISPR-Cas9 pooled competition screen and lineage tracking method developed by our lab for polyclonal tumours9, I will knock out a specific epigenetic regulator in individual cells of distinct HRD or FBI tumours to find recurrent hits across multiple PDX lines of each background. Each CRISPR guide is encoded with a unique molecular identifier (UMI) which identifies different clones receiving the same guide during computational analysis. To study cancer evolution in the face of drug treatment, I will carry out experiments in tumours generated under treatment with DNA targeting agents, leading to the development of acquired resistance in initially sensitive PDX lines6. 
Aim 2: Determine transcriptomic profiles of clones following knock-out of epigenetic regulators. I will leverage a single cell RNA sequencing method for pooled CRISPR screens that is able to also capture UMI tags10 to discover associations of transcriptional states with CNA-SV clones derived from matched single cell sequencing of whole genomes. This will uncover clonal and non-clonal determinants of fitness, as transcriptomic states observed in specific clones or across multiple clones respectively. 
Aim 3: Develop a CRISPR-Cas12a knockout system for multi-gene targeting to investigate synthetic lethal interactions. In order to interrogate how epigenetic regulators interact and uncover novel gene pairs that are only lethal when simultaneously knocked out, I will expand the current experimental system to include the simultaneous expression of programmable CRISPR guide pairs in the same cell. This method will be deployed in PDX tumours similarly to our current Cas9 system.
Impact: This work has the potential to extend our understanding of how epigenetic regulators contribute to cancer evolution in the face of DNA targeting agents, which will be key to the development of these compounds as anticancer drugs. Given the heterogeneity between and within patients with TNBC and HGSOC, identification of predictive biomarkers will be critical for actionable precision medicine.

Title: Investigating the role of epigenetic regulators in breast and ovarian cancer progression at single-cell resolution.

Summary:

Breast and ovarian cancers are deadly diseases with limited treatment options due to the genetic variability between and within patients. This variability is often hidden by traditional bulk tissue analysis, which makes it difficult to observe subgroups of cells within a tumor that share a common genetic change, called clones. Fitness, which describes the competition between clones for survival in a cancer, provides a basis for cancer evolution, such as susceptibility to drug therapies. In this project, we will use a new method to study single cells of clones in patient-derived mouse models representing the inherent variability of individual patients. Our aim is to identify candidate genes and their interactions that contribute to the complex multicellular behaviors of breast and ovarian cancer tumors, which is crucial for the development of emerging genetically targeted therapies.

This work will contribute to our understanding of the role of epigenetic regulators in cancer and its evolution over time, as well as their impact on the response to current and emerging therapeutic options in patients with breast or ovarian cancer.

Sex- and gender-based analysis:

We will use human tumor biopsies initially taken from patients of female biological sex, which have been propagated by the excision of the tumor and injection of dissociated tumor fragments into healthy female animals. However, as this is a molecular study that does not directly involve human research subjects, gender data was not collected, and it is not included in the analysis.

Methods and Procedures:

Aim 1: To quantify gene fitness of a library of epigenetic regulators in single-cell-derived tumour clones.

We will use an established CRISPR/Cas9-based approach7 to knock out individual genes encoding epigenetic regulators in single-cell-derived tumour clones. Knockout efficiency will be confirmed by sequencing of the targeted gene region. The relative fitness of each clone will be quantified by calculating the ratio of the knockout clone to a non-targeting control clone in a co-culture assay. The library will include at least 100 candidate genes that have been previously implicated in epigenetic regulation, as well as candidate genes that have not been previously linked to HRD or FBI backgrounds of genomic instability.

Aim 2: To identify epigenetic regulators associated with HRD and FBI backgrounds of genomic instability.

Tumour clones with HRD or FBI backgrounds of genomic instability will be identified by mutation signature analysis and CNA-SV clustering5. The gene fitness scores from Aim 1 will be analysed for association with these backgrounds. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)8 will be performed to identify epigenetic pathways that are over-represented in HRD and FBI backgrounds. The top candidate genes from the enriched pathways will be validated in a larger cohort of tumour clones using the same knockout and co-culture assays as in Aim 1.

Aim 3: To determine the impact of candidate epigenetic regulators on sensitivity or resistance to DNA targeting agents.

Tumour clones with HRD or FBI backgrounds will be treated with DNA targeting agents commonly used in the clinic, such as platinum-based chemotherapy or PARP inhibitors. The impact of knockout of candidate epigenetic regulators on sensitivity or resistance to these agents will be assessed using cell viability assays. In addition, RNA sequencing will be performed on treated and untreated cells to identify gene expression changes associated with the candidate epigenetic regulators.

Significance:

The proposed project aims to identify candidate epigenetic regulators that modulate the relative sensitivity or resistance of HRD and FBI tumour clones to DNA targeting agents. This could lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for TNBC and HGSOC, two cancers with limited treatment options and poor outcomes. The project will also contribute to our understanding of the role of epigenetic regulation in cancer pathogenesis and evolution, and provide insights into the clonal fitness landscape of tumours.

Dear Karen Hagan,

I am writing to express my interest in applying for the 2023 Rising Star competition in honor of Dr. Connie Eaves, as announced in your email on February 15th, 2023. As a trainee researcher in the field of cancer, I believe that this competition is an incredible opportunity to further my research and contribute to the next generation of cancer researchers.

My research proposal focuses on the identification of novel biomarkers for early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among women globally, and early detection plays a critical role in improving treatment outcomes and patient survival rates. My proposed research aims to identify novel biomarkers that can be used for early detection of breast cancer, particularly in populations with a higher risk of developing the disease.

I plan to conduct a comprehensive analysis of publicly available data sets to identify potential biomarkers for early detection of breast cancer. I will then perform laboratory experiments to validate the identified biomarkers and assess their diagnostic accuracy. I believe that this research will contribute to the development of more effective screening strategies for breast cancer, particularly in populations with a higher risk of developing the disease.

The Rising Star Awards funding of up to $50,000 ($25,000 per year for up to two years) would be instrumental in supporting my proposed research. I am confident that with this funding, I will be able to conduct rigorous experiments and collect high-quality data that will contribute to the advancement of the field of cancer research.

Thank you for considering my application for the 2023 Rising Star competition. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to the next generation of cancer researchers.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

Please rewrite the application based on the following - "Title: Investigating the role of epigenetic regulators in breast and ovarian cancer progression at single-cell resolution.
Summary:
Breast and ovarian cancers are deadly diseases with limited treatment options due to the genetic variability between and within patients. This variability is often hidden by traditional bulk tissue analysis, which makes it difficult to observe subgroups of cells within a tumor that share a common genetic change, called clones. Fitness, which describes the competition between clones for survival in a cancer, provides a basis for cancer evolution, such as susceptibility to drug therapies. In this project, we will use a new method to study single cells of clones in patient-derived mouse models representing the inherent variability of individual patients. Our aim is to identify candidate genes and their interactions that contribute to the complex multicellular behaviors of breast and ovarian cancer tumors, which is crucial for the development of emerging genetically targeted therapies.
We propose to combine existing experimental and statistical methods to assess gene fitness at single-cell resolution and apply this method to patient-derived mouse models of different patient tumors treated with chemotherapy or novel DNA-targeting drugs. This project will focus on epigenetics, the various marks on DNA and proteins that alter gene expression, and their role in breast and ovarian cancer progression. Individual tumor cells will be sequenced after knocking out different genes that regulate epigenetics to identify the most important genes and how they impact tumor growth. This work will contribute to our understanding of the role of epigenetic regulators in cancer and its evolution over time, as well as their impact on the response to current and emerging therapeutic options in patients with breast or ovarian cancer.
Sex- and gender-based analysis:
We will use human tumor biopsies initially taken from patients of female biological sex, which have been propagated by the excision of the tumor and injection of dissociated tumor fragments into healthy female animals. However, as this is a molecular study that does not directly involve human research subjects, gender data was not collected, and it is not included in the analysis.

We will use a new method to study single cells of clones in patient-derived mouse models representing the inherent variability of individual patients. Our aim is to quantify gene fitness of a library of epigenetic regulators in HRD or FBI backgrounds of genomic instability in TNBC and HGSOC to identify unique epigenetic regulators associated with HRD and FBI backgrounds of genomic instability in TNBC and HGSOC. We will use statistical methods to identify epigenetic regulators that warrant further investigation as actionable targets in HRD or FBI mutational backgrounds of TNBC and HGSOC, and we will further modulate relative sensitivity or resistance to DNA-targeting agents within these backgrounds.

Methods and Procedures:
Aim 1: To quantify gene fitness of a library of epigenetic regulators in single-cell-derived tumour clones.
We will use an established CRISPR/Cas9-based approach7 to knock out individual genes encoding epigenetic regulators in single-cell-derived tumour clones. Knockout efficiency will be confirmed by sequencing of the targeted gene region. The relative fitness of each clone will be quantified by calculating the ratio of the knockout clone to a non-targeting control clone in a co-culture assay. The library will include at least 100 candidate genes that have been previously implicated in epigenetic regulation, as well as candidate genes that have not been previously linked to HRD or FBI backgrounds of genomic instability.
Aim 2: To identify epigenetic regulators associated with HRD and FBI backgrounds of genomic instability.
Tumour clones with HRD or FBI backgrounds of genomic instability will be identified by mutation signature analysis and CNA-SV clustering5. The gene fitness scores from Aim 1 will be analysed for association with these backgrounds. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)8 will be performed to identify epigenetic pathways that are over-represented in HRD and FBI backgrounds. The top candidate genes from the enriched pathways will be validated in a larger cohort of tumour clones using the same knockout and co-culture assays as in Aim 1.
Aim 3: To determine the impact of candidate epigenetic regulators on sensitivity or resistance to DNA targeting agents.
Tumour clones with HRD or FBI backgrounds will be treated with DNA targeting agents commonly used in the clinic, such as platinum-based chemotherapy or PARP inhibitors. The impact of knockout of candidate epigenetic regulators on sensitivity or resistance to these agents will be assessed using cell viability assays. In addition, RNA sequencing will be performed on treated and untreated cells to identify gene expression changes associated with the candidate epigenetic regulators.
Significance:
The proposed project aims to identify candidate epigenetic regulators that modulate the relative sensitivity or resistance of HRD and FBI tumour clones to DNA targeting agents. This could lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for TNBC and HGSOC, two cancers with limited treatment options and poor outcomes. The project will also contribute to our understanding of the role of epigenetic regulation in cancer pathogenesis and evolution, and provide insights into the clonal fitness landscape of tumours.
